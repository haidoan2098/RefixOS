What's new: once the IRQ machinery is running, the kernel builds 3 static PCBs
— each has its own L1 table, its own kernel stack, and its own 1 MB user
memory (holding a copy of user_stub). TTBR0 is **not** swapped — boot_pgd is
still active; `current` is only a debug pointer. Only the next chapter actually
moves the CPU into a process.

---

## Principles

### The CPU has no idea what a "process" is

To the CPU, at any moment there is only one register set and one PC. It
doesn't know about "programs" — it only reads the instruction at PC, decodes,
executes. "Process" is a concept **invented by software**. To create the
illusion of multiple programs running at once, the kernel saves the CPU state
of each program into its own struct and swaps: save the current registers
into struct A, load registers from struct B → from here on, the CPU runs as
if it were B all along.

That state-carrying struct is called the **PCB (Process Control Block)**.
The swap operation is called a **context switch**. This chapter builds the
PCB; the context switch is in the next chapter.

### What a process needs

For the CPU to actually "be" process A, the kernel has to prepare 4 things:

1. **A CPU state snapshot** — r0–r12, SP, PC, CPSR, SPSR. On switch-in, load
   these registers exactly.
2. **An address space** — its own page table. A's user memory ≠ B's; both
   see the same kernel memory. This is the foundation of isolation.
3. **A kernel stack** — when A enters the kernel (via syscall or IRQ), the
   kernel runs C functions on a stack. That stack must belong to A, not be
   shared with other processes — see the Design section for why.
4. **User memory** — where A's code + data + stack live when it runs in user
   mode.

Missing any of these four and the process either can't run, or runs but
unsafely (corrupt stacks, leaked kernel data).

### Why "per-process" instead of sharing

**Per-process page table** means each process has its own VA→PA mapping. The
kernel changes the table on switch → process A can't see B's memory, not
because "it's forbidden" but because in A's map there's simply **no entry**
pointing at B's region. That's how Linux/Windows isolate processes.

The alternative some small kernels use is a **single shared page table**:
each process gets a different VA range in the same table. Convenient — no
TTBR0 swap, no TLB flush. But isolation disappears: A still has a VA entry
for B's region inside the same table; it's just "shouldn't be touched". A
buggy line of code and you corrupt each other.

RingNova picks **per-process page table** — following the project spec: "MMU
isolation is real". The cost: each switch writes TTBR0 and flushes the TLB.

---

## Context

```
Kernel state at the start of this chapter:
- MMU       : ON, boot_pgd active (identity RAM + high-VA + peripherals)
- IRQ       : ON, CPSR.I = 0, timer tick every 10 ms (tick_count rising)
- SVC stack : one stack shared across the whole kernel, _svc_stack_top (8 KB)
- "current" : doesn't exist yet — kmain runs directly
- PCB       : no struct, no notion of pid
```

The kernel has all the "lower-layer" pieces: it can read hardware, catch
faults, listen to interrupts. Nothing at the upper layer yet — the kernel is
still a single-threaded program.

---

## The problem

1. **No struct for multi-program state** — the CPU has one register set, one
   PC. To remember "3 programs" we need 3 snapshots. No struct exists for
   that.

2. **No private address spaces** — all code currently shares boot_pgd. There
   is no sense in which "process A lives here" beyond the VA its own code
   picks.

3. **No private kernel stacks** — without them, if A enters the kernel via
   syscall, is then preempted by a timer that switches to B, and B enters
   the kernel too, both would write to the same stack and corrupt each
   other. A per-process stack is needed from day one.

4. **No user memory** — the stub code and user stack for each process must
   be laid down before anything runs. The kernel must know which PA holds
   A's code and which user VA maps to it.

5. **"Not running" doesn't mean "no need to build"** — a common misconception
   is "set up when we need to run it". In practice, all infrastructure must
   be ready before the switch is flipped. Otherwise the context-switch
   chapter has to write tricky assembly **and** build data **and** debug
   both at once. Too risky.

This chapter solves 1–4 so the context-switch chapter only has to write the
assembly, with the data already in place.

---

## Design

### 3 static processes, no dynamic allocation

RingNova fixes `NUM_PROCESSES = 3` at compile time. No `process_create()`,
no fork, no allocator. PCBs live in the static array `processes[3]`, page
tables in `proc_pgd[3][4096]`, kernel stacks in `proc_kstack[3][8192]` —
everything in `.bss`.

Upsides:

- No allocator to implement
- Memory footprint known exactly at compile time
- Debugging is easy: PCB/PGD/stack addresses don't change between boots

Downsides (accepted): can't load external binaries, can't spawn new
processes. That's fine for the 3-process demo — that's also the project
scope.

### PCB layout: `ctx` goes first

```c
typedef struct {
    uint32_t r0, r1, r2, r3, r4, r5, r6, r7;
    uint32_t r8, r9, r10, r11, r12;
    uint32_t sp_svc;    /* kernel SP — points at the initial frame */
    uint32_t lr_svc;
    uint32_t spsr;      /* CPSR snapshot to restore on return to user */
    uint32_t sp_usr;    /* banked USR-mode SP                          */
    uint32_t lr_usr;
} proc_context_t;

typedef struct process {
    proc_context_t ctx;                   /* offset 0 — asm-friendly */
    uint32_t       pid;
    task_state_t   state;
    const char    *name;
    uint32_t      *pgd;                   /* VA of the L1 table  */
    uint32_t       pgd_pa;                /* PA — for TTBR0      */
    void          *kstack_base;
    uint32_t       kstack_size;
    uint32_t       user_entry;
    uint32_t       user_stack_top;
    uint32_t       user_phys_base;
} process_t;
```

Important detail: `ctx` sits at **offset 0**. The future context-switch
assembly only needs a pointer to the PCB (already held in `current`) to
access the context directly, without `+offset`. Tiny detail, but it shaves
one instruction off every switch.

`sp_svc` and `sp_usr` are separate because ARMv7-A has **banked SPs** —
each mode has its own physical SP register. In the kernel, the CPU uses
`sp_svc`; returning to user mode it switches to `sp_usr`. The PCB has to
remember both.

### Physical memory layout — one slot per process

```

Each process has **1 MB of private PA** for user memory. Three separate
slots — a bug in process A can't reach B's physical slot, let alone through
the MMU. That's why the project diagram cares about PA-level isolation vs
VA-level isolation.

Per-process kernel stacks are placed by the linker in BSS — their exact PA
depends on layout, not the `+0x117000` figure the memory-architecture doc
suggests. What matters is that each stack sits in the kernel region
(high-half), 8 KB each, 8-byte aligned — all satisfied. The `kstack_base`
field in the PCB holds the actual address the linker computed.

### One page table per process — but what's the same?

All 3 processes share the same kernel (same code, same static data, same
peripheral registers). Only the user region differs. So `proc_pgd[i]` is
built by **copying** the entries of boot_pgd, skipping the identity RAM
range, then installing exactly one user entry:

```
boot_pgd               proc_pgd[0]            proc_pgd[1]            proc_pgd[2]
─────────              ─────────              ─────────              ─────────
[0x000] FAULT    →     [0x000] FAULT          [0x000] FAULT          [0x000] FAULT
                                            (NULL guard for all 3)
[0x400] none     →     [0x400] → PA+0x200k   [0x400] → PA+0x300k    [0x400] → PA+0x400k
                                            (user VA, DIFFERENT)
[0x700] → RAM          [0x700] skip          [0x700] skip           [0x700] skip
(identity RAM, skip)                        (drop identity: no
                                             proc needs to reach
                                             kernel PA by subtraction)
[0xC00] → RAM    →     [0xC00] → RAM         [0xC00] → RAM          [0xC00] → RAM
(kernel high-VA)                            (kernel mirror, SAME)
[0x100] peripheral →   [0x100] peripheral    [0x100] peripheral     [0x100] peripheral
(QEMU peri) or                              (SAME)
[0x44E] (BBB peri)
```

The result:

- **NULL guard** preserved → every process Data Aborts on NULL deref
- **User section** (`0x40000000`): 3 processes point to 3 different PAs →
  real isolation
- **Kernel high-VA** (`0xC0000000`): same PA, same permissions → the kernel
  can always reach itself
- **Peripherals**: same — every process's syscalls see the same UART/timer
- **Identity RAM**: dropped → when context_switch swaps TTBR0 to
  `proc_pgd[i]`, the CPU loses access to the kernel's PA through identity.
  That's fine: the kernel has already trampolined PC into high-VA at boot
  (`ldr pc, =_start_va` in `start.S` right after `mmu_enable` — see chapter
  03), so PC is in `0xC0...`, and that entry exists in both `boot_pgd` and
  every `proc_pgd[i]`. Swapping TTBR0 doesn't need another trampoline.

### Inline user stub — 3 physical copies

The code the processes will eventually run is **embedded in the kernel
image** as a `.user_stub` section:

```asm
.section .user_stub, "ax"
user_stub_start:
    mov     r0, #1
1:  b       1b
user_stub_end:
```

A short instruction sequence (does nothing useful — the process isn't
running yet). `process_init_all` uses `memcpy` to write those bytes to 3
different PAs (PA+0x200000, PA+0x300000, PA+0x400000).

Why copy instead of sharing one original? If all 3 processes pointed
`pgd[0x400]` at the same PA, then physically there would be **no isolation**
— one chunk of RAM holds the code, and one process self-patching would
affect the other two. A separate copy per process = real physical isolation
at the byte level. Every instruction has its own RAM address.

Later, when syscalls exist, all 3 processes execute the same logic (because
the copies are byte-for-byte identical), but they can **modify their own
code** without affecting the others — the correct model for a real OS.

### Initial kernel stack frame — built now, used later

When the context-switch chapter is written, the logic for resuming a
process will be:

```
msr   spsr_cxsf, <ctx.spsr>          @ load SPSR
mov   sp, <ctx.sp_svc>               @ point SP at the initial frame
ldmfd sp!, {r0-r12, pc}^             @ atomic pop of 14 words, SPSR → CPSR
```

The `ldmfd` with the trailing `^` flag: pops r0–r12 + PC **and** copies
SPSR into CPSR in the same instruction. That's how ARM returns from an
exception atomically — it changes both PC and mode bits in one shot.

For that instruction to work, 14 words must already be on the kernel stack
in ascending pop order:

```
low addr  ┌──────────────┐ ← ctx.sp_svc (SP to pop from)
          │ r0  = 0      │ [+0x00]
          │ r1  = 0      │ [+0x04]
          │ ...          │
          │ r12 = 0      │ [+0x30]
          │ pc  = 0x40M  │ [+0x34]  ← user_entry
high addr └──────────────┘ ← kstack_base + 8 KB (stack top)
```

`process_init_all` builds this frame at setup time. The r0–r12 values are
zero (the process starts with clean registers), pc = `USER_VIRT_BASE =
0x40000000` (entry into the user stub), spsr = `0x10` (USR mode, IRQ+FIQ
unmasked, ARM state), sp_usr = `0x40100000` (top of user stack).

The next chapter needs only 3 instructions to turn the CPU into a running
user-mode process. That's why the frame is built in advance: it takes risk
out of the hard part (context-switch assembly).

---

## How it operates

### The `process_init_all` flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant KM as kmain
    participant PI as process_init_all
    participant MC as memcpy
    participant PG as pgtable_build_for_proc
    participant PCB as processes[i]

    KM->>PI: after irq_init + per-line irq_enable
    loop i = 0, 1, 2
        PI->>PCB: zero, set pid/name/state=READY
        PI->>PCB: pgd = proc_pgd[i]<br/>kstack = proc_kstack[i]<br/>user_pa = RAM+0x200000+i*0x100000
        PI->>MC: memcpy(user_pa, user_stub_start, stub_size)
        Note over MC: 3 physical copies
        PI->>PG: pgtable_build_for_proc(pgd, user_pa)
        PG->>PG: zero 4096 entries
        PG->>PG: copy boot_pgd (skip identity RAM)
        PG->>PG: pgd[0x400] = user_pa | PDE_USER_TEXT
        PI->>PCB: build initial frame on kstack<br/>ctx.sp_svc / spsr / sp_usr
    end
    PI->>KM: current = &processes[0]
```

End state: 3 complete PCBs, 3 populated PGDs, 3 copies of the user_stub in
RAM, `current` pointing at PCB 0. **TTBR0 is still unchanged** — boot_pgd
is still doing the translation.

### Two parallel maps — boot_pgd vs proc_pgd[i]

```
       boot_pgd (ACTIVE — TTBR0 points here, identity dropped after self-tests)
       ┌────────────────────────────────────┐
       │ 0x000: FAULT      (NULL guard)     │
       │ 0x400: FAULT      (no user yet)    │
       │ 0x700-0x77F: FAULT (dropped)       │  ← mmu_drop_identity cleared
       │ 0xC00-0xC7F: high-VA alias RAM     │  ← kernel runs here
       │ 0x100/0x1E0: peripherals           │
       └────────────────────────────────────┘

       proc_pgd[0]  (READY — not active yet)
       ┌────────────────────────────────────┐
       │ 0x000: FAULT                       │
       │ 0x400: → RAM_BASE+0x200000 (user)  │  ★
       │ 0x700-0x77F: FAULT (no identity)   │
       │ 0xC00-0xC7F: high-VA (same)        │
       │ 0x100/0x1E0: peripherals (same)    │
       └────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Once `mmu_drop_identity()` has run, `boot_pgd` and `proc_pgd[i]` are **very
similar** apart from entry `0x400` (the process-specific user section).
That's the invariant that makes the context switch compact: swap TTBR0 to
`proc_pgd[i]`, the kernel still runs through `0xC0...`, and user code at
`0x40000000` now points at the new process's PA.

### Key points

**The linker keeps 16 KB alignment for every L1 table**:

```ld
.bss (NOLOAD) :
{
    . = ALIGN(16384);       /* boot_pgd */
    *(.bss.pgd)
    . = ALIGN(16384);       /* 3 × proc_pgd, aligned contiguous */
    *(.bss.proc_pgd)
    *(.bss*)
    ...
}
```

An L1 table has to be 16 KB aligned because TTBR0 requires it. With a
`proc_pgd[3][4096]` array, each row is exactly 16 KB, so aligning once at
the start is enough — the rest follow automatically.

**`pgtable_build_for_proc` — a copy-from-boot strategy**:

```c
for (uint32_t i = 0; i < PGD_ENTRIES; i++) {
    if (boot_pgd[i] == 0) continue;
    if (i >= ident_lo && i < ident_hi) continue;  /* skip identity RAM */
    pgd[i] = boot_pgd[i];
}
pgd[USER_VIRT_BASE >> 20] = (user_pa & 0xFFF00000U) | PDE_USER_TEXT;
```

We don't hard-code a list of peripherals per platform — we iterate boot_pgd
and copy every non-zero entry (except the identity RAM). The result:
peripherals, the kernel high-VA alias, high vectors (if any are added
later) are all mirrored automatically. To change platform, just change
`board.h` + `mmu.c`; process.c and pgtable.c don't move.

**`PDE_USER_TEXT` — the correct attribute for user code**:

```c
#define PDE_USER_TEXT  (PDE_TYPE_SECTION | PDE_C | PDE_B \
                        | PDE_AP_KERN_USER_RW | PDE_DOMAIN(0))
```

Cacheable, bufferable, kernel+user RW, **not** XN (execute-never) — the
user section must be executable. Domain 0, like every other entry (DACR =
client for domain 0, the AP bits carry the actual access rights).

**Wired into kmain** (after IRQ setup):

```c
process_init_all();            /* ★ build 3 PCBs */

mmu_drop_identity();           /* drop identity RAM PA→PA after copying binaries */

timer_set_handler(scheduler_tick);   /* arm preemption — until now the
                                      * timer only bumped tick_count,
                                      * it didn't preempt */

process_first_run(&processes[0]);    /* rfefd → USR, CPSR.I=0 atomic */
```

The order is not optional: `process_init_all` reads `boot_pgd` (available
after `mmu_init`) and uses `uart_printf` (available after `uart_init`).
Calling it before those dependencies either crashes the kernel or fails
silently.

## Testing

Three new tests added to `run_boot_tests`:

| Test | Verifies | Failure means |
|------|----------|---------------|
| **T7** | PCB array: `pid == i`, `state == READY`, `pgd != NULL`, 16 KB aligned, correct `user_phys_base` offset | Init didn't run / field is wrong |
| **T8** | Per-process L1 entry: `pgd[0]==0` (NULL guard), `pgd[0x400]` is a section with user-RW + the right PA, `pgd[0xC00] == boot_pgd[0xC00]` (kernel mirror), 3 distinct user PDEs | PGD build is wrong / PAs collide |
| **T9** | Initial frame: r0–r12 = 0, frame `pc` = `USER_VIRT_BASE`, `ctx.spsr == 0x10`, `ctx.sp_usr == USER_STACK_TOP` | Stack frame doesn't match ldmfd format |

**QEMU output:**

```
[PROC] pid=0 name=counter pgd=0xc0108000 kstack=0xc0114210 user_pa=0x70200000
[PROC] pid=1 name=runaway pgd=0xc010c000 kstack=0xc0116210 user_pa=0x70300000
[PROC] pid=2 name=shell   pgd=0xc0110000 kstack=0xc0118210 user_pa=0x70400000
...
[TEST] [PASS] T7 PCB array (3 processes)
[TEST] [PASS] T8 L1 mappings (null+user+kern OK, 3 distinct user PAs)
[TEST] [PASS] T9 initial stack frames (pc=USER_VIRT_BASE, spsr=0x10)
[TEST] ========== 9 passed, 0 failed ==========
```

- `pgd` prints at **high-VA** (`0xc0108000`, `0xc010c000`, `0xc0110000`)
  because the linker emits symbols at VA. The 16 KB alignment still holds
  (the VA→PA offset is itself a multiple of 16 KB).
- `pgd_pa` (not printed in the boot log but stored in the PCB) = `pgd -
  PHYS_OFFSET` — that's the value TTBR0 will receive during a context
  switch.
- `user_pa` is still printed at PA: the user region uses PA for isolation;
  it isn't linker-dependent.

**Not tested yet (belongs to the next chapter):**

- Whether a process actually runs — no context switch yet
- Whether TTBR0 swap does its job — no swap yet
- Whether an interrupt while in user mode restores context correctly —
  user mode doesn't exist in this chapter's scope

### Dependencies

- **Chapter 03 — MMU**: `boot_pgd` must be complete before
  `pgtable_build_for_proc` copies entries from it; `PDE_*` attribute
  macros are defined there
- **Chapter 04 — Interrupts**: no direct dependency, but the next chapter
  (Context Switch) will hook into the IRQ return path — the groundwork
  has to be ready
- **CLAUDE.md**: "No dynamic allocation — static only"; "Exception stacks
  are only trampolines; kernel logic runs on per-process kernel stacks"

### Next

**Chapter 06 — Scheduler + Context Switch →** The PCBs are built but the
CPU hasn't touched them. The next chapter writes `context_switch.S`: save
prev's registers into `prev->ctx`, swap TTBR0 to `next->pgd_pa`, flush
the TLB, restore registers from `next->ctx`, and atomically pop back into
user mode. Because the kernel runs at high VA from boot, swapping TTBR0
needs no trampoline — PC in `0xC0...` is shared across every PGD. Paired
with a round-robin scheduler called from the timer IRQ, this is the first
time 3 processes actually interleave on the terminal.

Điểm mới: sau khi IRQ hoạt động, kernel build 3 PCB tĩnh — mỗi PCB có L1 table riêng,
kernel stack riêng, 1 MB user memory riêng (chứa bản sao của user_stub). TTBR0 **không**
bị swap — boot_pgd vẫn đang active, `current` chỉ là một pointer debug. Chapter sau mới
thực sự chuyển CPU vào process.

---

## Nguyên lý

### CPU không biết "process" là gì

Với CPU, tại một thời điểm chỉ có một tập register + một PC. Nó không biết "chương trình"
— chỉ biết đọc instruction tại PC, decode, execute. "Process" là khái niệm do **phần mềm
đặt ra**. Muốn tạo ảo giác nhiều chương trình chạy cùng lúc, kernel lưu trạng thái CPU
của mỗi chương trình vào struct riêng, rồi hoán đổi: save register hiện tại vào struct
A, load register từ struct B → từ đây CPU chạy như thể nó luôn là B.

Struct lưu trạng thái đó gọi là **PCB (Process Control Block)**. Hành động hoán đổi gọi
là **context switch**. Chapter này dựng PCB; context switch nằm ở chapter kế tiếp.

### Một process cần những gì

Để CPU thật sự có thể "là" process A, kernel phải chuẩn bị đủ 4 thứ:

1. **Snapshot CPU state** — r0–r12, SP, PC, CPSR, SPSR. Khi swap vào, load nguyên vẹn
   các register này.
2. **Address space** — page table riêng. User memory của A ≠ của B; cả hai nhìn chung
   vào kernel memory. Đây là nền tảng isolation.
3. **Kernel stack** — khi A vào kernel (qua syscall hoặc IRQ), kernel chạy hàm C trên
   stack. Stack này phải thuộc về A, không chung với process khác — xem lý do ở phần
   Thiết kế.
4. **User memory** — nơi chứa code + data + stack của A khi nó chạy ở user mode.

Khi một trong 4 thứ này thiếu, process không chạy được — hoặc chạy được nhưng không an
toàn (corrupt stack, leak kernel data).

### Vì sao "per-process" thay vì dùng chung

**Per-process page table** nghĩa là mỗi process có bảng dịch VA→PA riêng. Kernel thay đổi
bảng khi switch → process A không thấy được memory của process B, không phải vì "bị cấm"
mà vì trong bản đồ của A đơn giản **không có entry nào** trỏ đến vùng của B. Đây là cách
Linux/Windows isolate process.

Ngược lại, một số kernel nhỏ dùng **page table duy nhất**: mỗi process ở VA khác nhau
nhưng cùng một bảng. Tiện — không cần swap TTBR0, không cần flush TLB. Nhưng mất
isolation: process A vẫn có entry VA cho vùng của B trong cùng bảng, chỉ "không nên"
truy cập. Lỗi code = corrupt nhau.

RingNova chọn **per-process page table** — đi theo spec dự án: "MMU isolation là thật".
Cost: mỗi switch phải ghi TTBR0 và flush TLB.

---

## Bối cảnh

```
Trạng thái kernel lúc vào Chapter 04:
- MMU       : ON, boot_pgd active (identity RAM + high-VA + peripherals)
- IRQ       : ON, CPSR.I = 0, timer tick mỗi 10 ms (tick_count tăng)
- SVC stack : chung cho toàn kernel, _svc_stack_top (8 KB)
- "current" : chưa tồn tại — kmain chạy trực tiếp
- PCB       : chưa có struct, chưa có khái niệm pid
```

Kernel đã có đủ mảnh "phía dưới": đọc hardware được, bắt fault được, nghe interrupt được.
Chưa có gì ở tầng trên cả — kernel vẫn là một chương trình đơn tuyến.

---

## Vấn đề

1. **Không có cấu trúc lưu trạng thái nhiều chương trình** — CPU chỉ có 1 bộ register, 1
   PC. Muốn nhớ "3 chương trình" thì phải có 3 bản snapshot. Chưa có struct nào.

2. **Không có address space riêng** — tất cả code đang dùng chung boot_pgd. Không có
   nghĩa nào để nói "process A ở đâu" ngoài VA do code của nó chọn.

3. **Không có kernel stack riêng** — nếu sau này A gọi syscall và trong khi đang trên
   kernel stack thì timer fire, kernel switch sang B, B cũng gọi syscall → cả hai ghi
   lên cùng stack → corrupt nhau. Cần stack per-process ngay từ đầu.

4. **Không có user memory** — stub code, user stack của process phải được cấp sẵn trước
   khi process chạy. Kernel phải biết PA nào chứa code của A, ánh xạ vào VA user nào.

5. **"Chưa chạy" không phải "không cần dựng"** — một quan niệm sai là "khi nào cần chạy
   mới setup". Thực tế: tất cả infrastructure phải sẵn sàng trước khi bấm công tắc. Nếu
   không, chapter context switch sẽ đồng thời phải: viết assembly khó + dựng data +
   debug cả hai cùng lúc. Rủi ro rất cao.

Chapter này giải quyết 1-4, để chapter context switch chỉ còn việc viết assembly đã có
đủ data bên dưới.

---

## Thiết kế

### 3 process tĩnh, không dynamic

RingNova cố định `NUM_PROCESSES = 3` từ compile time. Không có `process_create()`, không
có fork, không có allocator. PCB nằm trong mảng tĩnh `processes[3]`, page table nằm
trong `proc_pgd[3][4096]` tĩnh, kernel stack trong `proc_kstack[3][8192]` tĩnh. Toàn bộ
trong `.bss`.

Lợi ích:
- Không cần implement bất kỳ allocator nào
- Memory footprint biết chính xác lúc compile
- Debug dễ: địa chỉ PCB/PGD/stack không đổi giữa các lần boot

Hạn chế (chấp nhận): không load binary từ ngoài, không spawn process mới. Đủ cho demo
3 process cố định — đó cũng là scope dự án.

### Layout PCB: `ctx` đứng đầu

```c
typedef struct {
    uint32_t r0, r1, r2, r3, r4, r5, r6, r7;
    uint32_t r8, r9, r10, r11, r12;
    uint32_t sp_svc;    /* kernel SP — trỏ vào initial frame */
    uint32_t lr_svc;
    uint32_t spsr;      /* CPSR snapshot để restore khi về user */
    uint32_t sp_usr;    /* banked USR mode SP                    */
    uint32_t lr_usr;
} proc_context_t;

typedef struct process {
    proc_context_t ctx;                   /* offset 0 — asm-friendly */
    uint32_t       pid;
    task_state_t   state;
    const char    *name;
    uint32_t      *pgd;                   /* VA của L1 table  */
    uint32_t       pgd_pa;                /* PA — cho TTBR0   */
    void          *kstack_base;
    uint32_t       kstack_size;
    uint32_t       user_entry;
    uint32_t       user_stack_top;
    uint32_t       user_phys_base;
} process_t;
```

Quan trọng: `ctx` ở **offset 0**. Context switch assembly sau này chỉ cần pointer vào PCB
(đã có sẵn trong `current`) là truy cập được context ngay, không phải `+offset`. Chi tiết
nhỏ nhưng cắt giảm 1 instruction mỗi lần switch.

`sp_svc` và `sp_usr` tách rời vì ARMv7-A có **banked SP** — mỗi mode có SP vật lý khác
nhau. Lúc ở kernel, CPU dùng `sp_svc`; khi trả về user mode, CPU đổi sang `sp_usr`. PCB
phải nhớ cả hai.

```

Mỗi process có **1 MB PA riêng** cho user memory. Ba ô tách biệt — lỗi process A không
chạm được vào ô của B ngay ở tầng physical, chưa kể MMU. Đây là lý do diagram project
chú ý phân biệt PA-level isolation vs VA-level isolation.

Kernel stack per-process được linker đặt trong BSS — PA chính xác tùy layout, không cố
định `+0x117000` như doc memory-architecture đề xuất. Điều gì quan trọng là stack nằm
trong kernel region (cao), 8 KB mỗi stack, align 8-byte — đều thỏa. Symbol `kstack_base`
trong PCB trỏ đến địa chỉ cụ thể được linker tính.

### Mỗi process, một page table — nhưng giống nhau ở chỗ nào?

Cả 3 process dùng chung cùng một kernel (cùng code, cùng data tĩnh, cùng peripheral
register). Chỉ khác ở vùng user. Do đó `proc_pgd[i]` được xây bằng cách **copy** các
entry của boot_pgd, trừ phần identity RAM, rồi thêm đúng một entry user:

```
boot_pgd               proc_pgd[0]            proc_pgd[1]            proc_pgd[2]
─────────              ─────────              ─────────              ─────────
[0x000] FAULT    →     [0x000] FAULT          [0x000] FAULT          [0x000] FAULT
                                            (NULL guard cho cả 3)
[0x400] none     →     [0x400] → PA+0x200k   [0x400] → PA+0x300k    [0x400] → PA+0x400k
                                            (user VA, KHÁC NHAU)
[0x700] → RAM          [0x700] bỏ            [0x700] bỏ             [0x700] bỏ
(identity RAM, skip)                        (xóa identity: không ai
                                             trong proc cần access PA
                                             của kernel bằng cách trừ)
[0xC00] → RAM    →     [0xC00] → RAM         [0xC00] → RAM          [0xC00] → RAM
(kernel high-VA)                            (kernel mirror, GIỐNG)
[0x100] peripheral →   [0x100] peripheral    [0x100] peripheral     [0x100] peripheral
(QEMU peri) hoặc                            (GIỐNG)
[0x44E] (BBB peri)
```

Kết quả:

- **NULL guard** giữ nguyên → tất cả process deref NULL đều Data Abort
- **User section** (`0x40000000`): 3 process trỏ 3 PA khác nhau → isolation thật
- **Kernel high-VA** (`0xC0000000`): cùng PA, cùng permission → kernel luôn access được
- **Peripherals**: cùng — tất cả process gọi syscall đều thấy UART/timer
- **Identity RAM**: xoá → khi context switch swap TTBR0 sang `proc_pgd[i]`, CPU mất
  quyền truy cập PA của kernel qua identity. Điều này không phải vấn đề: kernel đã
  trampoline PC vào high-VA từ lúc boot (`ldr pc, =_start_va` trong `start.S` ngay
  sau `mmu_enable` — xem chapter 03), nên PC nằm trong `0xC0...` — entry này tồn
  tại trong cả `boot_pgd` lẫn mọi `proc_pgd[i]`. Swap TTBR0 không cần trampoline thêm.

### Inline user stub — 3 bản sao vật lý

Code mà process sẽ chạy được **nhúng trong kernel image** như một section `.user_stub`:

```asm
.section .user_stub, "ax"
user_stub_start:
    mov     r0, #1
1:  b       1b
user_stub_end:
```

Một chuỗi instruction ngắn (không cần làm gì thật — process chưa chạy). `process_init_all`
dùng `memcpy` ghi các byte này vào 3 PA khác nhau (PA+0x200000, PA+0x300000, PA+0x400000).

Tại sao copy thay vì share cùng một bản? Nếu cả 3 process trỏ `pgd[0x400]` về cùng một
PA, thì ở góc độ physical, **không có isolation** — 1 địa chỉ RAM duy nhất chứa code,
một process patch ghi vào nó sẽ ảnh hưởng 2 process kia. Copy riêng mỗi bản = isolation
thật từ tầng vật lý. Mỗi byte code đều có địa chỉ RAM riêng biệt.

Lần chap sau khi có syscall, 3 process sẽ thực thi đúng cùng logic (vì bản copy byte-by-
byte), nhưng có thể **modify code** của chính mình mà không ảnh hưởng process khác — đây
là mô hình đúng với OS thật.

### Initial kernel stack frame — dựng trước, dùng sau

Khi chapter context switch viết xong, logic resume một process sẽ là:

```
msr   spsr_cxsf, <ctx.spsr>          @ load SPSR
mov   sp, <ctx.sp_svc>               @ trỏ SP vào initial frame
ldmfd sp!, {r0-r12, pc}^             @ atomic pop 14 words, SPSR → CPSR
```

Lệnh `ldmfd` với cờ `^` ở cuối: pop r0–r12 + PC **đồng thời** copy SPSR sang CPSR. Đây
là cách ARM return từ exception nguyên tử — thay đổi cả PC và mode bit trong 1 lệnh.

Để lệnh đó hoạt động, phải có sẵn 14 word trên kernel stack đúng thứ tự pop ascending:

```
low addr  ┌──────────────┐ ← ctx.sp_svc (SP để pop)
          │ r0  = 0      │ [+0x00]
          │ r1  = 0      │ [+0x04]
          │ ...          │
          │ r12 = 0      │ [+0x30]
          │ pc  = 0x40M  │ [+0x34]  ← user_entry
high addr └──────────────┘ ← kstack_base + 8 KB (đỉnh stack)
```

`process_init_all` xây frame này ngay lúc setup. Giá trị r0–r12 = 0 (process bắt đầu
với register sạch), pc = `USER_VIRT_BASE = 0x40000000` (điểm vào user stub), spsr =
`0x10` (USR mode, IRQ+FIQ unmasked, ARM state), sp_usr = `0x40100000` (đỉnh user stack).

Chapter kế tiếp chỉ cần 3 instruction để chuyển CPU thành process đang chạy ở user mode.
Đây là lý do frame được dựng sẵn: giảm rủi ro cho phần khó (context switch assembly).

## Cách hoạt động

### Luồng `process_init_all`

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant KM as kmain
    participant PI as process_init_all
    participant MC as memcpy
    participant PG as pgtable_build_for_proc
    participant PCB as processes[i]

    KM->>PI: sau irq_init + irq_enable per-line
    loop i = 0, 1, 2
        PI->>PCB: zero, set pid/name/state=READY
        PI->>PCB: pgd = proc_pgd[i]<br/>kstack = proc_kstack[i]<br/>user_pa = RAM+0x200000+i*0x100000
        PI->>MC: memcpy(user_pa, user_stub_start, stub_size)
        Note over MC: 3 bản copy vật lý
        PI->>PG: pgtable_build_for_proc(pgd, user_pa)
        PG->>PG: zero 4096 entries
        PG->>PG: copy boot_pgd (skip identity RAM)
        PG->>PG: pgd[0x400] = user_pa | PDE_USER_TEXT
        PI->>PCB: build initial frame on kstack<br/>ctx.sp_svc / spsr / sp_usr
    end
    PI->>KM: current = &processes[0]
```

Kết thúc hàm: 3 PCB hoàn chỉnh, 3 PGD populated, 3 bản user_stub trong RAM, `current`
trỏ vào PCB 0. **TTBR0 vẫn chưa đổi** — boot_pgd đang dịch địa chỉ.

### Hai bản đồ song song — boot_pgd vs proc_pgd[i]

```
       boot_pgd (ACTIVE — TTBR0 trỏ đây, identity đã drop sau self-tests)
       ┌────────────────────────────────────┐
       │ 0x000: FAULT      (NULL guard)     │
       │ 0x400: FAULT      (chưa có user)   │
       │ 0x700-0x77F: FAULT (dropped)       │  ← mmu_drop_identity xoá
       │ 0xC00-0xC7F: high-VA alias RAM     │  ← kernel đang chạy ở đây
       │ 0x100/0x1E0: peripherals           │
       └────────────────────────────────────┘

       proc_pgd[0]  (READY — chưa active)
       ┌────────────────────────────────────┐
       │ 0x000: FAULT                       │
       │ 0x400: → RAM_BASE+0x200000 (user)  │  ★
       │ 0x700-0x77F: FAULT (no identity)   │
       │ 0xC00-0xC7F: high-VA (giống)       │
       │ 0x100/0x1E0: peripherals (giống)   │
       └────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Sau khi `mmu_drop_identity()` chạy, `boot_pgd` và `proc_pgd[i]` giờ **rất giống nhau**
ngoại trừ entry `0x400` (user section riêng của mỗi process). Đó chính là bất biến cần
để context switch gọn: swap TTBR0 sang `proc_pgd[i]`, kernel vẫn chạy qua `0xC0...`,
user code ở `0x40000000` giờ trỏ đúng PA của process mới.

### Điểm chính

**Linker giữ alignment 16 KB cho mỗi L1 table**:

```ld
.bss (NOLOAD) :
{
    . = ALIGN(16384);       /* boot_pgd */
    *(.bss.pgd)
    . = ALIGN(16384);       /* 3 × proc_pgd, aligned contiguous */
    *(.bss.proc_pgd)
    *(.bss*)
    ...
}
```

L1 table phải 16 KB aligned vì TTBR0 register yêu cầu. Với mảng `proc_pgd[3][4096]`,
mỗi row đúng 16 KB, nên chỉ cần align một lần ở đầu — các row sau tự động align.

**`pgtable_build_for_proc` — chiến thuật copy-from-boot**:

```c
for (uint32_t i = 0; i < PGD_ENTRIES; i++) {
    if (boot_pgd[i] == 0) continue;
    if (i >= ident_lo && i < ident_hi) continue;  /* skip identity RAM */
    pgd[i] = boot_pgd[i];
}
pgd[USER_VIRT_BASE >> 20] = (user_pa & 0xFFF00000U) | PDE_USER_TEXT;
```

Không hard-code danh sách peripheral theo platform — iterate boot_pgd và copy tất cả
entry non-zero (trừ identity RAM). Kết quả: peripherals, kernel high-VA alias, high
vectors (nếu sau này có) tự động được mirror. Thay platform → thay `board.h` + `mmu.c`;
file process.c và pgtable.c không cần động.

**`PDE_USER_TEXT` — attribute đúng cho user code**:

```c
#define PDE_USER_TEXT  (PDE_TYPE_SECTION | PDE_C | PDE_B \
                        | PDE_AP_KERN_USER_RW | PDE_DOMAIN(0))
```

Cacheable, bufferable, kernel+user RW, **không** XN (execute never) — user section phải
executable. Domain 0, như mọi entry khác (DACR = client cho domain 0, AP bits quyết định
quyền thực).

**Wire vào kmain** (sau IRQ setup):

```c
process_init_all();            /* ★ dựng 3 PCB */

mmu_drop_identity();           /* identity RAM PA→PA xoá sau khi copy binaries */

timer_set_handler(scheduler_tick);   /* arm preemption — cho đến giờ timer
                                      * chỉ bump tick_count, không preempt */

process_first_run(&processes[0]);    /* rfefd → USR, CPSR.I=0 atomic */
```

Thứ tự không đảo được: `process_init_all` đọc `boot_pgd` (đã có từ `mmu_init`) và dùng
`uart_printf` (đã có từ `uart_init`). Nếu gọi trước những dependency đó, kernel crash
hoặc silent fail.

## Testing

Thêm 3 test vào `run_boot_tests`:

| Test | Kiểm tra | Fail nghĩa là |
|------|----------|----------------|
| **T7** | PCB array: `pid == i`, `state == READY`, `pgd != NULL`, align 16 KB, `user_phys_base` đúng offset | Init không chạy / field sai |
| **T8** | Per-process L1 entry: `pgd[0]==0` (NULL guard), `pgd[0x400]` là section với user-RW + PA đúng, `pgd[0xC00] == boot_pgd[0xC00]` (kernel mirror), 3 user PDE khác nhau | PGD build sai / PA trùng |
| **T9** | Initial frame: r0–r12 = 0, pc ở frame = `USER_VIRT_BASE`, `ctx.spsr == 0x10`, `ctx.sp_usr == USER_STACK_TOP` | Stack frame không đúng format cho ldmfd |

**Kết quả trên QEMU:**

```
[PROC] pid=0 name=counter pgd=0xc0108000 kstack=0xc0114210 user_pa=0x70200000
[PROC] pid=1 name=runaway pgd=0xc010c000 kstack=0xc0116210 user_pa=0x70300000
[PROC] pid=2 name=shell   pgd=0xc0110000 kstack=0xc0118210 user_pa=0x70400000
...
[TEST] [PASS] T7 PCB array (3 processes)
[TEST] [PASS] T8 L1 mappings (null+user+kern OK, 3 distinct user PAs)
[TEST] [PASS] T9 initial stack frames (pc=USER_VIRT_BASE, spsr=0x10)
[TEST] ========== 9 passed, 0 failed ==========
```

- `pgd` in ở **VA cao** (`0xc0108000`, `0xc010c000`, `0xc0110000`) vì linker emit symbol
  ở VA. 16 KB-aligned vẫn giữ (offset giữa VA và PA là bội 16 KB).
- `pgd_pa` (không in trong boot log, nhưng lưu trong PCB) = `pgd - PHYS_OFFSET` — đó là
  giá trị TTBR0 sẽ nhận khi context switch.
- `user_pa` vẫn in ở PA: user region dùng PA cho isolation, không lệ thuộc linker.

**Chưa test (thuộc chapter sau):**
- Process thực sự chạy — chưa có context switch
- TTBR0 swap có việc không — chưa swap
- Interrupt xảy ra khi đang ở user mode có restore context đúng không — user mode chưa
  tồn tại trong scope này

| [kernel/include/proc.h](../../kernel/include/proc.h) | Public types + API |
| [kernel/proc/process.c](../../kernel/proc/process.c) | Static init logic |

### Dependencies

- **Chapter 03 — MMU**: `boot_pgd` phải hoàn chỉnh trước khi `pgtable_build_for_proc`
  copy entry từ đó; `PDE_*` attribute macros đã định nghĩa
- **Chapter 04 — Interrupts**: không phụ thuộc trực tiếp, nhưng chapter tiếp theo
  (Context Switch) sẽ hook vào IRQ return path — nền cần sẵn
- **CLAUDE.md**: "Không dùng dynamic allocation — static only"; "Exception stack chỉ là
  trampoline, kernel logic chạy trên kernel stack per-process"

### Tiếp theo

**Chapter 06 — Scheduler + Context Switch →** PCB đã dựng xong, nhưng CPU vẫn chưa chạm
vào chúng. Chapter sau viết assembly `context_switch.S`: save register của prev vào
`prev->ctx`, swap TTBR0 sang `next->pgd_pa`, flush TLB, restore register từ `next->ctx`,
atomic pop về user mode. Vì kernel chạy ở VA cao từ boot, swap TTBR0 không cần trampoline
— PC trong `0xC0...` chia sẻ giữa mọi PGD. Kèm scheduler round-robin gọi từ timer IRQ —
lần đầu tiên 3 process thực sự interleave trên terminal.
